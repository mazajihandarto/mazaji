    <p>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare is a first-person shooter video game developed by Infinity Ward and published by Activision. Serving as the sixteenth overall installment in the Call of Duty series, as well as a reboot of the Modern Warfare sub-series,[1][2][3] it was released on October 25, 2019, for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

The game takes place in a realistic and modern setting. The campaign follows American CIA officers and British SAS forces as they team up with rebels from the fictional country of Urzikstan, combating together against Russian forces who have invaded the country. The game's Special Ops mode features cooperative play missions that follow up the campaign's story. The multiplayer mode supports cross-platform multiplayer for the first time in the series. It has been reworked for gameplay to be more tactical and introduces new features, such as a Realism mode that removes the HUD as well as a form of the Ground War mode that now supports 64 players.

Infinity Ward began working on the game soon after the release of their 2016 title Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare. They introduced an entirely new engine for the game, which allows for new performance enhancements such as more detailed environments and ray tracing capabilities. For the campaign, they took influence from real-life conflicts, such as the Syrian Civil War and terrorist incidents that have occurred in London. For the multiplayer, they scrapped the franchise's traditional season pass and removed loot boxes, enabling them to distribute free post-launch content to the playerbase.[4]

The game received a mixed pre-release reception for its mature subject matter, but nonetheless was released to positive reviews. Praise was directed towards the gameplay, story, multiplayer, and graphics, with some criticism being aimed at the handling of the campaign's subject matter as well as balancing issues in the multiplayer. In addition, there was controversy regarding the single-player campaign's depiction of the Russian military.</p>

    <p>Devil May Cry 5[a] is an action-adventure hack and slash video game developed and published by Capcom. It is the sixth installment in the franchise and the fifth installment of the mainline Devil May Cry series. Capcom released it for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One on March 8, 2019. The game takes place five years after Devil May Cry 4 and follows a trio of warriors with demonic powers: Dante, Nero and a new protagonist named V as they attempt to stop the Demon King Urizen, from destroying the human world. Across the game, the player can use these characters in different missions. Each of them has their own way of fighting and becoming stronger. As this happens, the mystery behind V is revealed along with his connection with Urizen.

Devil May Cry 5 was directed by Hideaki Itsuno whose goal was for this installment to be his best work. He aimed to make the game balanced for both newcomers and returning gamers by providing adequate, difficult and new demons. Capcom also wanted to bring a more realistic design inspired by the "RE Engine" used in their previous work, Resident Evil 7: Biohazard. As a result, models were used to make the character's faces. The plot was written by returning writer Bingo Morihashi while the setting was based on various locations in London. Multiple composers worked together to produce the game's audio, creating three main themes centered around the playable characters.

Devil May Cry 5 received positive reviews from critics. Many lauded it as a return to form for the franchise, praising the variety of techniques the three characters bring, with V standing out thanks to his distinctive style of commanding underlings. The game had sold over two million copies less than two weeks after its release. A light novel and manga related to the game have also been released.</p>
